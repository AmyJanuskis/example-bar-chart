# Example Flourish bar chart template

This is a supersimple template for a bar chart in Flourish. The bar chart is based on Mike Bostock's bar chart example over [here](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304).

## How this works

- The sample data lives in `data/data.csv`
- We add a setting for bar fill and bind the data in `template.yml`
- The code for drawing the chart lives in `src/index.js`

## How to run this

- [Install Flourish](https://flourish.studio/developers/) and `flourish run` to run the template
- More info about publishing this template to Flourish [can be found here](https://flourish.studio/developers/quickstart/publish-to-flourish/)
